/*
Now when the application terminates, it gracefully closes the Mongoose connection
before it ends.
Similarly, when nodemon restarts the application due to changes in the
source files, the application closes the current Mongoose connection first. The nodemon
listener is using process.once as opposed to process.on, as you want to listen
for the SIGUSR2 event only once in the application, since it will be emitted twice; the
first SIGUSR2 is for our application's use, while the second is for nodemon's use.
Since nodemon listens for this same event, you donâ€™t want to capture it each time, thus
preventing nodemon from working properly.
